# ViT-for-Image-Captioning
Implementation of Vision Transformer to solve image captioning task, a simple way to achieve SOTA, in Pytorch

* Image captioning model based on Image2Seq Architecture (CNN Feature Extractor + LSTM with MultiHead Attention)
Basic model to understand task. I created model, you can use/develop it for free :) Easy to implement. Fast to train. Fun to caption.

* ViT for Masked-Image Modeling
Plan to use it as feature extractor in Image2Seq and in Full Transformer Architectures.
